 <h2> What is go-weathertracker? </h2>
 This project can be used to get weather info like temprature and humidity if any city of the world. This is inspired by akhil sharma's go project. However, I also added the humdity feature which was not in original project.<br>
 <h2> What I learnt? </h2>
 By this simple project, I learnt about using an external api, creating a local server, marshaling and unmarshaling in golang, and some standard go packages. <br>
